# veneur-docker

Make [venuer](https://github.com/stripe/veneur) dockerized.

**NOTE**: this is a modified version of the fork, no current attempt has been made to pull these changes back in, though it may make sense in the future

## Usage

The Dockerfile has been made such that configuration can be provided using environment variables, which will then be used to populate the configuration file that is provided to `veneur`. This templating is done using [confd](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd)

The currently supported environment variabled are:

* `DD_API_KEY`: **required** The API key used to communicate with datadog
* `STATS_ADDRESS`: defaults to `0.0.0.0:8125`
* `UDP_ADDRESS`: defaults to `0.0.0.0:8126`
* `HTTP_ADDRESS`: defaults to `0.0.0.0:8127`
* `FORWARD_ADDRESS`: default is to not set
* `TAGS`: a comma separated list of tags to be applied to all metrics

For more details on what these configuration parameters and how they affect veneur, please see their [documentation](https://github.com/stripe/veneur#configuration).

## Making Changes

* Modify [config template](confd/templates/config.yaml.tmpl)
* Add new variables to [confd config](confd/conf.d/veneur.toml)
